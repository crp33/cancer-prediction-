# Logistic Regression
Using a breast cancer dataset to build a logistic regression model that accuartely predicts if cancer is malignant or not based on certain measurements.

# Data from Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set
Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. n the 3-dimensional space is that described in: [K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: "Robust Linear Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets", Optimization Methods and Software 1, 1992, 23-34].

# JupyterLab
Project was built in jupyterlab using pandas, seanborn, and sklearn
